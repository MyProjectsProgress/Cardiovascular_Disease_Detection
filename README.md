# Cardiovascular_Disease_Detection

## Project Description

Several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been increasingly utilized for cardiovascular disease prediction. We aim to assess and summarize the overall predictive ability of ML algorithms in cardiovascular diseases. Although inadequate studies for each algorithm for meta-analytic methodology for both heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias because the confidence intervals overlap between different methods, showing no difference. The predictive ability of ML algorithms in cardiovascular diseases is promising, particularly decision tree. However, there is heterogeneity among ML algorithms in terms of multiple parameters. This information may assist clinicians in how to interpret data and implement optimal algorithms for their dataset.

## Project Steps

1) Cleaning of data was performed, outliers were taken rid of,
2) Duplicates were removed.
3) There were no NULL value so we started making the Machine learning model.
4) Machine learning model was made using the decision tree.
5) Grid search was used to improve the accuarcy from 63% to 73%.
6) Data Visualization was made to describe the relation among columns.
7) Input page was made with 2 steps and after entering the data a submit button will reflect to the results page where the data is save for patients to access.
